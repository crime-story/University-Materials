# Intermediate deliverable Estate Team

## Problem statement
_Young people that move to Bucharest (for college, work or other reasons) are having a hard time choosing rents in the city because relevant information is hard to find. To help them have a smoother experience we will build an Estate Ad Portal that will allow the comparison of ads and also gather some common information about the neighborhoods to help in the decision making process._

## Project charter
#### **_Opportunity_**
- _When choosing a place to rent it's difficult to asses whether the offer you are given is a good deal or not._

#### **_Goal_**
- _Build a website that will generate high online traffic by facilitating the access to information for users of our website._

#### **_Objectives_**
- _Have at least 100.000 visits during Q2 and Q3 of the first year since release_
- _Have at least 10.000 unique visitors within the first year since release_
- _Have a page/visit rate of at least 5 within the first year since release_
 
#### **_Business case_**
- _The project is profitable and can be scaled to further increase business_

#### **_Project Scope_**
  - _In scope_
    - _Build a website_
  - _Deliverables_
    - _Estate ads can be published on the website_
    - _Articles and reviews can be published on the website_
  - _Out of Scope_
    - _Mediating transactions between tenants and owners_
    - _Messaging feature between users_
 
#### **_Constraints_**
- _Limited time_
- _Project's budget_
 
#### **_Assumptions_**
- _The website will be free to use and enough revenue can be generated through commercial ads._
- _The city of Bucharest has a dynamic population due to the universities and jobs available. Thus, if the project is not successful for just this area in particular, it would not have had any success if we were to build for a much larger one._
- _Estate owners using our website have a low number of estates to rent so limiting the allowed number of ads to 3 is sufficient and there won't be complaints in that regard in the initial phase of the project._
- _Registered users of our website only have deeper knowledge of a few particular areas of the city so limiting the allowed number of articles to 5 is sufficient and there won't be complaints in that regard in the initial phase of the project._

#### **_Risks_**
- _People will be reluctant to move from the website they are already using_
- _An online community that actively uses and improves the content is is not guaranteed to be formed_
- _People will use the website in undesired ways (posting unrelated ads and articles)_

## Functional decomposition
**_Functionality_** | **_MoSCoW Priority_** | **_Sprint Planning_**

A site visitor can see all the published articles | M | Sprint 3
A site visitor can filter the list of articles by neighborhood | S | Sprint 3
A site visitor can sort the list of articles by publication date | S | Sprint 3
The solution will use well known techniques in order to be SQL injection proof. (This strongly relates to a non-functional integrity requirement, that the content of  the database will not be altered by unauthorized people. We consider this to be a functional requirement since it describes an implementation detail that is mandatory in order to attain the non-functional and broader requirement) | M | Sprint 1-100  (needs continuous care)

Sprint Period | 28 Nov 2022 - 11 Dec 2022
Sprint Goal | Complete the initial setup of the application. Create the database and the backend server. On the frontend create the pages needed for account creation and authentication. Also create a Profile page for authenticated users.
Stories and Time Committed | 13 Tasks  \| 20 hours
Stories and Time Delivered | <ul> <li>9 Tasks   \| 22 hours </li> <li> 1 task was discarded from sprint and will be solved later on when the team finds an appropriate solution</li> <li> the other 3 tasks were moved to the next sprint  </li>   </ul>
Comments on Sprint Report | During the first dev sprint our focus was to allow users to register and get authenticated on our website. We decided to remove a task from the sprint and come back to it when we had all the tools needed to implement it. Some tasks had to be delayed to the next sprint since we encountered some difficulties with the initial setup that took a consistent part of the planned workload.

## Architecture Report

The main quality attributes of the application are performance and security. 

Performance is required by both users and the product owner. Users need an application that responds to their actions within a reasonable amount of time. The product owner also values this attribute for the same reason, since having a large pool of satisfied clients that continue to use the application is imperative for the success of the product from a business perspective. Security is necessary for people to trust and keep using the application.

In order to have security we have used some common tactics such as input validation and actors authorization.
For performance we have avoided using indirection so that we do not create computational overhead.

In our application we used a client-server architecture. Separating the presentation, application and data access layers allows the development team to work independently on different layers. Having a single data center means there won't be synchronization problems between storage units. The drawback of this architecture is that there is no redundant communication connections. If the application layer were to fail then the data won't be able to reach the presentation layer. It is also vulnerable to DOS type of attacks since congestion at the server side will render all services unavailable.

## Software Testing Report

#### Unit Tests

We could not perform realistic tests for [performance requirements](https://github.com/inginerie-software-22-23/proiect-inginerie-software-estate-team/wiki/Intermediate-deliverable---Estate-Team#performance) since any test that we would have run would not have taken into account the latency of data transfer. What we managed to test were some security and data integrity related aspects. We created unit tests to check that at sign up credentials are properly validated and that users can't alter content that they are not authorized to.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80215860/215326920-7e4c464e-23f9-4b38-8df2-115e6093d9fa.png" width=550>

#### Manual tests performed

To validate our [functional requirements](https://github.com/inginerie-software-22-23/proiect-inginerie-software-estate-team/wiki/Intermediate-deliverable---Estate-Team#functional-decomposition) we have ran manual test procedures following the scenarios described in those requirements and also the scenarios described in the acceptance criteria of some user stories. Some of them can be viewed in the application demo made at the end of a sprint. Below we have provided some requirements and screenshots of our website when we were validating their implementation.

#### Security concerns that were addressed

Since the application accepts user inputs we had to assume that there will be some people with malicious intentions and guard against common threats that appear when working with user provided information. The most common attacks on the input forms are the SQL injections and cross-site scripting. In order to test the implementation against these types of attacks we have taken the role of malicious users and tried to change the content of the database and add scripts in our inputs that would run on other people's browser and we failed (successfully? ðŸ˜…).


#### Relevant metrics for the application

For our application we have found a number of relevant metrics:

- Time needed to process a request on the backend server. While we can't asses the network latency that our users will face when using the website, making sure the backend servers delivers the results as fast as possible is a good start.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80215860/215329101-2f8a828d-83f0-49fd-a7f6-85bd57087719.png" width=500>

- Number of concurrent request the server can handle simultaneously. During the peak season of hunting for accommodations it is expected that the server will receive a large number of requests in a short amount of time and in order to ensure the availability of our solution we have make some tests. We hypothesized that if the server can handle 100 simultaneous request then it should hold during the initial launch without problems. If it proves not to be enough later on when the user base rises measures can be taken to increase the capacity at that time.
