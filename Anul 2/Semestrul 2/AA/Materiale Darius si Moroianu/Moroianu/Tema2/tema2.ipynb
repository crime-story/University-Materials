    "We wish to find a maxima point for a function given as input.\\\n",

    "For finding the optimal point we are going to perform a genetic evolution of a population, where each individual represents a potential point of maxima, using a base-2 encoding.\n",

    "## The Genetic Evolution\n",

    "* Select the top $p_1$ percent of the population (according to the individuals' fintnesses.\n",
