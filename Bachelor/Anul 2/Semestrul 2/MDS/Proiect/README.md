# Emergency App

## Software Development Methods Project

Implemented an Android Application for Emergencies in Kotlin 1.7.0 version and stored data with Firebase, which is meant to help any person, at any time, even those with disabilities, very easy. :heart:

### User stories implemented:
- [x] Users can register with personal information (phone number, email address, gender, age) and can set a password and after that they can authentificate with email address and password
- [x] Users can access a page where they see all the emergency phone numbers in Romania
- [x] As a user I want to see a quick guide (preview) of this application
- [x] Users can access the chat where can see what assistants are online and can help with their problem
- [x] As an assistant I want to be able to communicate with my collegues
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to talk with an assistant to help me with a medical emergency about myself or someone I care about.
- [x] Users can see a map with their location in real time and the locations around (hospitals, police centers, vet etc.)
- [x] As a user I want to be able to talk with an assistant to help me with an emergency about my pet
- [x] Assistants can see on the database the informations of the users
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to talk with an assistant to help me if someone is following me and call the police for me

### Bugs that we fixed:
- [x] App didn't work on the first device we tested, because it didn't have installed Google Play on it
- [x] App was crashing due SignUp button (SignUp Activity was missing from ActivityManifest.XML)
- [x] App was crashing due Location Permissions (PermissionsActivity was missing from ActivityManifest.XML).
- [x] A progress dialog from ProfileEditActivity kept looping because we forgot to close it
- [x] App was crashing due Intro Guide (at SetContentView for guidepage2 and guidepage3 we had "first page guide") 

### Technologies used:
- Android Studio
- Firebase
- Kotlin
- Git

### Build tools used:
- Gradle

### Source control:
We have created a 'main' branch that contains the application in the final stage and a branch for 'bug-fixing'.
You can find these branches [(here)](https://github.com/alinavoiculescu/EmergencyApp/branches) or with graphic interface [(here)](https://github.com/alinavoiculescu/EmergencyApp/network).

### Additional:
- Used Adapter Design Pattern for Messages and User.
- Used regex expressions for some validations:
  * Year of birth
  * Email
  * Phone number
  * Password
- Every user who wants to register must confirm his account through his personal email.
- Every user who forgot his password and wants to reset it must confirm this action through his personal email.
- Handled various exceptions, such as those generated by Firebase Database statements, to make debugging easier.
